- human brain climate change East Africa's Rift Valley
  - we know that the jump of human brain size occurred in East Africa's Rift Valley, lots of data supports that
  - during that time the earth orbit was elliptical, circular, and there were other factors driven by gravitational interactions
  - the gravitational influences led to climate change, which led to our brain size change (intelligence increase), it was 1.8 million years ago, which also led to big increased number of species in the Rift Valley

- the simulation theory
  - cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the oldest light in the universe
  - 380,000 years after the big bang, the universe became transparent for the first time to light, because it was cooling down and expanding, it became cool enough for atoms to form. All of this happened very fast. And the photons were able to travel because of this ever since. we have photograph of it

  - inflationary cosmology theory (this is a widely accepted theory): before the universe was hot and dense (which was the big bang), the universe was still there, but it was doing something else, which was exponential expansion during its first few moments. it was expanding extremely fast, way faster than the speed of light. and then it stops, so all the energy that was causing the expansion got dumped into space, which heats it up, and that's what we see as the particles and energy today.
  - eternal inflation theory: how long did that period of expansion last? did it stop at once? or did it stop in patches? if it stopped in patches, then each patch would create an universe, so there might be infinite number of big bangs that created infinite number of universes like ours, and will continue to create universes forever. so you get this **fractal multiverse** ever growing exponentially fast. and these theories have some support.
  - in each pocket universe of this multiverse, you get different physical constants, only some of them would allow life to exist, so our universe is a very fine tuned universe.
  - The Higgs boson, the higgs particle, predicted in the 60s, early on in the expansion history of the universe, less than a billionth of a second after the big bang, as the universe cooled, it went through something condense out into the empty space (or a transition, phase sth). it's like water condensed into ice when the temperature drops. So the theory is, the universe appeared to be "empty" to us is actually not empty, it's full of higgs particles, so when it cooled down, our fundamental particles, the electrons interact with higgs particles, and they acquire mass in this process, so this is a mass generation machenism. That's why some particles are massive, like electrons and quarks, and some are massless, like photons, which can travel through the space at the speed of light. It was only a theory and no evidence back in the 60s,  (standard model of particle physics), now we've built the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) to test if the theory is correct, which turned out to be correct.
  - After the Higgs mechanism in the history of universe, you still have a period still too hot for the neutrons and photons to form, **the building blocks of nuclei are neutrons and photons**, both protons and neutrons are made of 3 quarks, each proton is made of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, each neutron is made of 1 up quark and 1 down quarks. ![Fig. 1: An oversimplified vision of protons as made from two up quarks and a down quark, and neutrons as made from two down quarks and an up quark — and nothing else.](https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nucleons1.png?w=661&h=370)
  - In the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe cooled, conditions became just right to give rise to the building blocks of matter – the quarks and electrons of which we are all made. A few millionths of a second later, quarks aggregated to produce protons and neutrons. Within minutes, these protons and neutrons combined into nuclei. As the universe continued to expand and cool, things began to happen more slowly. It took 380,000 years for electrons to be trapped in orbits around nuclei, forming the first atoms. These were mainly helium and hydrogen, which are still by far the most abundant elements in the universe. Present observations suggest that the first stars formed from clouds of gas around 150–200 million years after the Big Bang. Heavier atoms such as carbon, oxygen and iron, have since been continuously produced in the hearts of stars and catapulted throughout the universe in spectacular stellar explosions called supernovae.

  - neutron star is 1.4 time the mass of the sun, but would have the redius of around 10 miles
  - the speeding up of the expansion fo the universe is because of the dark energy (65% - 70% of the energy in the universe)
  - it's possible to create a blackhole if you have extra dimensions. gravity is a very weak force, by far the weakest fundamental forces of nature (there are four fundamental forces of nature:gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force).
  - so how far can you go back in time towards the big bang that it was so hot that gravity was the strongest of the forces? (the strength of these forces change with energy, it's observed)
  - **grand unified theory**
  - if you want to create a black hole with these energies, it's not gonna be enough, but if you allow extra dimensional space, then you can arrange that energy scale in which gravity becomes important to come up to the temperature to drop, so then you can arrange in a way to access gravity, see gravity in action. (1:05:50) and then jumped to the point that cosmic ray and then blackholes are here on earth...
  - the possibility for extraterrestrial life
    - probably there are about 20 billion earth like planets in the Milky way galaxy, meaning the small rocky planets in the Circumstellar habitable zone (goldilocks zone)
    - so maybe 1 in 10 stars in the sky has a earth like planet around it potentially, so there is life in the universe probably
    - then the question becomes, how likely is it for simple life, if it arises, to evolve into a civilisation?
    - biologists would say to astranomers, you might think there are lots of places suitable for life, but it took 3.8 billion years (about 1/3 of the age of the universe) on earth to go from the origin of life to where we are now, a civilisation.
    - to get to a civilisation, you need to have an unbroken stable line of life that continues to evolve in the "right" way
    - cambrian explosion (550 million years ago), before that, there was nothing we'd call complex, there were only single cell organisations doing some clever stuff, like photosynthesis. but all of a sudden, you get a big jump of the oxygen content in the atmosphere on earth, which has lots to do with photosynthesis, that's how you get complex life, and then the complex life evolved into a civilisation.
    - even after that, homo sapiens only arose 200,000 years ago, so for the vast majority of the history of life on earth, there was nothing could do something that clever, in terms of thinking, etc.
    - so we know there's a high probility of earth like planets out there, but 1. we don't know the probability of the emergence of life 2. how likely that life form would evelve into a civilisation
    - academic biologists tend to be on the conservative side, while astronaumers tend to be on the optimistic side
    - 350 billion galaxies in the observable universe, so very likely there are civilisations out there. But it's unlikely we can get in touch with them, but inside our milky way galaxy, it's worth the effort to listen to them
    - before SETI started back in the 60s, no planets were discovered beyond the solar system, but since then, we've confirmed discoveries of thousands of planets
    - the speed of light is a fundamental part of the structure of space-time, is essential to the **general relativity** theory. it is the thing that protects the *cause & effect* of the past, present and the future.
    - when you approach the speed of light, time slows down. if photon has a watch, that watch would be 7000 times slower than our watch. So you can move through time in different rates. the faster you go than other the slower your watch moves.
    - if you go at speed of light, you don't age. no time passes
