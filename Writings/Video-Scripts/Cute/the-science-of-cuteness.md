title: The Science of Cuteness
---

Biologist Konard Lorenz researched the "kinderschema", or "Child Scheme"

A set of traits that define what we consider cute:

- Big forehead
- Large eyes
- Rounded features
- Large head-to-body ratio
- Round body
- Soft texture

We find animals cute when they share the same traits, and human nurturing instinct programs us to take cure of anything that looks baby-like, this even works for inanimate objects

When shown cute photos, two parts of the brain are activated:

- Nucleus Accumbens: the pleasure centre that releases dopamine, the same chemical your brain releases on drugs
- Orbitofrontal Cortex: the area responsible for decision making

to keep this instinctive protection, humans have evolved to stay childlike for as long as possible, this is called neoteny

Most animals without neoteny are self-sufficient after birth

fish, reptiles and insects aren't considered "cute"

if you have a bad day, watch some cute animal videos for a quick dopamine pick-me-up
