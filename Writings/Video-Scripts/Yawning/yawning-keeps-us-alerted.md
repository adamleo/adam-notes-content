title: Yawning Keeps Us Alerted
---

Researchers used to think that yawning was only signaling a need for sleep, turns out [it's not true](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031938495020144). *"Yawning frequency is unrelated to prior amount of sleep, or to times of awaking or retiring. More yawning occurred during the week than during weekends."*

but now they believe that it can communicate a shift in alertness or boredom.

A series of studies conducted in the eighties and nineties demonstrated that people report yawning more frequently when they are **feeling tired**. They are especially prone to yawning in the hour immediately after waking and the hour preceding their usual bedtimes.

Yawning also **increases with boredom**. In one experiment, the study's subjects were separated into 2 groups, 1 group was asked to watch a television test pattern for 30 minutes, while another was asked to watch music videos for 30 minutes. Subjects yawned about 70 percent more during the test pattern than during the music video condition.

In one experiment, studies' subjects *yawned far more frequently when looking at static TV screen than when watching music videos*.

We also **yawn when we’re getting hungry**—a tendency we appear to share with other primates.

**Boredom, hunger, fatigue**: these are all states in which we may find our *attention drifting and our focus becoming more and more difficult to maintain*. This is when yawning becomes a signal that helps our bodies to stay alert. Just as a [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21331826/) stated: *A major function of yawning appears to involve maintenance or increase of arousal when environments provide relatively little stimulation.*

You don't have to be bored to yawn. Athletes sometimes yawn before games, live performers may yawn before getting on stage. The incidence of yawning would go up just before Army Special Forces soldiers they made their way to the cabin door before jumping out of an airplane for the first time.

Robert Provine (a neuroscientist) believes, **a yawn may signal a change of physiological state**: a way to help our mind and body transition from one behavioral state to another—"sleep to wakefulness, wakefulness to sleep, anxiety to calm, boredom to alertness."
