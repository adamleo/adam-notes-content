title: The Damage of Mouthbreathing

Mouthbreathing can put the body into a state of stress that can make us more quickly fatigued and sap athletic performance.

Mouthbreathing leads to sickness and is disrespectful, he told me, which is why he and everyone else he grew up with in Puebla, Mexico, learned to breathe through the nose.

Mouthbreathing, it turns out, changes the physical body and transforms airways, all for the worse. Inhaling air through the mouth decreases pressure, which causes the soft tissues in the back of the mouth to become loose and flex inward, creating less space and making breathing more difficult. Mouthbreathing begets more mouthbreathing. Inhaling from the nose has the opposite effect. It forces air against all those flabby tissues at the back of the throat, making the airways wider and breathing easier. After a while, these tissues and muscles get “toned” to stay in this opened and wide position. Nasal breathing begets more nasal breathing.

Forced mouthbreathing was very likely changing the shape of my airways, just as it did with Harvold’s monkeys. The changes weren’t happening in a matter of months, either, but days. It was getting worse with every breath I took.

## During Sleep

Sleeping with an open mouth exacerbates these problems. Whenever we put our heads on a pillow, gravity pulls the soft tissues in the throat and tongue down, closing off the airway even more. After a while, our airways get conditioned to this position; snoring and sleep apnea become the new normal.

When seasonal allergies hit, incidences of sleep apnea and breathing difficulties shoot up. The nose gets stuffed, we start mouthbreathing, and the airways collapse. “It’s simple physics,” McKeown told me. Sleeping with an open mouth exacerbates these problems. Whenever we put our heads on a pillow, gravity pulls the soft tissues in the throat and tongue down, closing off the airway even more. After a while, our airways get conditioned to this position; snoring and sleep apnea become the new normal.

Mouthbreathing causes the body to lose 40 percent more water.

“For they that sleep with their Jaws extended, by reason of their breath, and the air tossed to and fro, have their tongues and palates dry, and desire to be moistened by drinking in the night.”
