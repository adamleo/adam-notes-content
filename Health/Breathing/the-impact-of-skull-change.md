title: The Impact of Skull Change
---

When mouths don’t grow wide enough, the roof of the mouth tends to rise up instead of out, forming what’s called a V-shape or high-arched palate.6 The upward growth impedes the development of the nasal cavity, shrinking it and disrupting the delicate structures in the nose. The reduced nasal space leads to obstruction and inhibits airflow. Overall, humans have the sad distinction of being the most plugged-up species on Earth.

Evans and her colleague Dr. Kevin Boyd, a Chicago-based pediatric dentist, have spent the last four years X-raying more than 100 skulls from the Morton Collection and measuring the angles from the top of the ear to the nose and from the forehead to the chin. These measurements, which are called the Frankfort plane and N-perpendicular, show the symmetry of each specimen, how well-proportioned the mouth was relative to the face, the nose to the palate, and, to a large extent, how well the people who owned these skulls might have breathed.

Every one of the ancient skulls had enormous forward-facing jaws. They had expansive sinus cavities and broad mouths. And, bizarrely, even though none of the ancient people ever flossed, or brushed, or saw a dentist, they all had straight teeth. The forward facial growth and large mouths also created wider airways. These people very likely never snored or had sleep apnea or sinusitis or many other chronic respiratory problems that affect modern populations. They did not because they could not. Their mouths were far too large, and their airways too wide for anything to block them. They breathed easy. Nearly all ancient humans shared this forward structure—not just in the Morton Collection, but everywhere around the world. This remained true from the time when Homo sapiens first appeared, some 300,000 years ago, to just a few hundred years ago.

Evans and Boyd then compared the ancient skulls to the modern skulls of their own patients and others. Every modern skull had the opposite growth pattern, meaning the angles of the Frankfort plane and N-perpendicular were reversed: chins had recessed behind foreheads, jaws were slumped back, sinuses shrunken. All the modern skulls showed some degree of crooked teeth. Of the 5,400 different species of mammals on the planet, humans are now the only ones to routinely have misaligned jaws, overbites, underbites, and snaggled teeth, a condition formally called malocclusion.

> “Why would we evolve to make ourselves sick?”

***Evolution doesn’t always mean progress***, Evans told me. It means change. And life can change for better or worse. Today, the human body is changing in ways that have nothing to do with the “survival of the fittest.” Instead, we’re adopting and passing down traits that are detrimental to our health. This concept, called dysevolution, was made popular by Harvard biologist Daniel Lieberman, and it explains why our backs ache, feet hurt, and bones are growing more brittle.11 Dysevolution also helps explain why we’re breathing so poorly.

The innovation of mashing and cooking food, however, had consequences. The quickly growing brain needed space to stretch out, and it took it from the front of our faces, home to sinuses, mouths, and airways. Over time, muscles at the center of the face loosened, and bones in the jaw weakened and grew thinner. The face shortened and the mouth shrank, leaving behind a bony protuberance that replaced the squashed snout of our ancestors. This new feature was ours alone and distinguished us from other primates: the protruding nose.

The problem was that this smaller, vertically positioned nose was less efficient at filtering air, and it exposed us to more airborne pathogens and bacteria. The smaller sinuses and mouth also reduced space in our throats. The more we cooked, the more soft, calorie-rich food we consumed, the larger our brains grew and the tighter our airways became.

Strangely, sadly, the same adaptations that would allow our ancestors to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlive other animals—a mastery of fire and processing food, an enormous brain, and the ability to communicate in a vast range of sounds—would obstruct our mouths and throats and make it much harder for us to breathe. This recessed growth would, much later, make us prone to choke on our own bodies when we slept: to snore.

None of this mattered to the early humans, of course. For tens of thousands of years, our ancestors would use their wildly developed heads to breathe just fine. Armed with a nose, a voice, and a supersized brain, humans took over the world.

## The Function Of Larynx

The larynx works as a valve to shuttle food into the stomach and protect us from inhaling it and other objects.

As humans developed speech, the larynx sank, opening up space in the back of the mouth and allowing a wider range of vocalizations and volumes.

More nimble and flexible tongues made it easier to control the nuance and structure of sounds, so the tongue slipped farther down the throat and pushed the jaw forward.

But this lowered larynx became less efficient at its original purpose. It created too much space at the back of the mouth and made early humans susceptible to choking. We could choke if we swallowed something too big, and we’d choke on smaller objects that were swallowed quickly and sloppily. Sapiens would become the only animals, and the only human species, that could easily choke on food and die.

Inflammation in the throat and polyps both contribute to snoring and sleep apnea.
