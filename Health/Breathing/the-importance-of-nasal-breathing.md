title: The Importance of Nasal Breathing
---

Mammals grew noses to warm and purify the air, throats to guide air into lungs, and a network of sacs that would remove oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the blood. The aerobic cells that once clung to swampy rocks so many eons ago now made up the tissues in mammalian bodies. These cells took oxygen from our blood and returned carbon dioxide, which traveled back through the veins, through the lungs, and into the atmosphere: the process of breathing.

It was all going so well until about 1.5 million years ago, when the pathways through which we took in and exhaled air began to shift and fissure. It was a shift that, much later in history, would affect the breathing of every person on Earth.

For the past century, the prevailing belief in Western medicine was that the nose was more or less an ancillary organ. We should breathe out of it if we can, the thinking went, but if not, no problem. That’s what the mouth is for. Many doctors, researchers, and scientists still support this position. There are 27 departments at the National Institutes of Health devoted to lungs, eyes, skin disease, ears, and so on. The nose and sinuses aren’t represented in any of them.

Forty percent of today’s population suffers from chronic nasal obstruction, and around half of us are habitual mouthbreathers, with females and children suffering the most. The causes are many: dry air to stress, inflammation to allergies, pollution to pharmaceuticals. But much of the blame, I’ll soon learn, can be placed on the ever-shrinking real estate in the front of the human skull.

“Whatever happens to the nose affects what’s happening in the mouth, the airways, the lungs,” said Patrick McKeown during a phone interview. He’s a bestselling Irish author and one of the world’s leading experts on nasal breathing. “These aren’t separate things that operate autonomously—it’s one united airway,” he told me.

“More wholesome to sleep … with the mouth shut,” wrote Levinus Lemnius, a Dutch physician from the 1500s who was credited as one of the first researchers to study snoring.
