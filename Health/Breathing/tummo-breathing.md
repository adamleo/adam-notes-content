[Tummo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummo) is a Tibetan word for ***Inner Fire***. It is an ancient meditation technique practiced by monks in Tibetan Buddhism. Tummo exists in a combination of breathing and visualization techniques, used to enter a deep state of meditation that is used to increase a person’s "inner heat". This inner heat enables people to control ones body temperature, for example keeping the body warm in cold conditions.

### 3 Channels

The **"center channel"** is the whole arterial system, or more specifically the aorta. The two **"side channels"** are the venous system and the spinal column and nervous system. A *chakra* is any place in the body where there are clusters of arteries, veins and nerves.

In the practice of tummo, the visualization of lower ends to the three channels is primarily used to focus body awareness in the subnavel area. Breath retention, mulabandha and uddiyana bandha force vāyu (wind, air) and ojas into the arterial system. Ojas itself has two stores within the body—the heart and brain. Thus there is the visualization of blazing and dripping.
