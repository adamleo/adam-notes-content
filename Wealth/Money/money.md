Money has many faces. It is **Power**. It's **Energy**. It's the **Glue of Society**.

It's not evil, it's does not discriminate, it's the most just equaliser in the world.

Money is not chased after, it's not made:

[[The Pursuit Of Money]] is a *spiritual journey* (spiritual can be constructive & destructive). It helps us establishing our *personalities* (good or evil), our *worldview* (big or small), our *value* (noble or unimpressive). When money feels corrupted, or destructive, it's not money itself, but rather, it's how humans reacting to money without understanding it. And when this happens, a person becomes a slave to money.
